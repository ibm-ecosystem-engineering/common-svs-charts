# Helm

Helm is a package manager. Package managers automate the process of installing, configuring, upgrading, and removing computer programs. Examples include the Red HatÂ® Package Manager (RPM), Homebrew, and Windows PackageManagement.

An application in OpenShift typically consists of at least two resource types: a deployment resource, which describes a set of pods to be deployed together, and a services resource, which defines endpoints for accessing the APIs in those pods. The application can also include ConfigMaps, Secrets, and Ingress.
